# Maximum Contracts: 3

# Suppose:
- Winning Rate: 0.55
- Losing Rate: 0.45
- Target Profit per Trade: $200
- Target Loss per Trade: $100

## Target Profit and Loss per Trade:
- You have a target profit of $200 per trade.
- You are using 3 contracts in total.
- The "contracts utilization per trade" is 0.666 (2/3), meaning approximately 2 out of the 3 contracts are utilized for each trade.
- With this contract utilization:
  - If your target profit is $200, using 2 out of 3 contracts on average means you need to use one contract to earn $100.
  - Similarly, if your target loss is $100, using 2 out of 3 contracts on average means you need to use one contract to incur a loss of $50.

## Time Consideration with ENQ (Micro E-mini Nasdaq 100):
- The average value fluctuation per contract for ENQ is $16 over 5 minutes.
  - In a trend:
    - To earn $100, you would need to wait for 25 - 30 minutes on average.
    - If scalping, you might need to execute 5-6 separate trades.
  - To incur a loss of $50, you would need to wait for 15-20 minutes in a trend, or trade separately 2-3 times if scalping.

# Expected Value:
- \(EV = (Winning Rate \times Target Profit per Trade) - (Losing Rate \times Target Loss per Trade)\)
- \(EV = (0.55 \times 200) - (0.45 \times 100) = 110 - 45 = 65\)
- On average, each trade has an expected value of + $65.

# Estimation for Reaching $3000 Target Profit:
- Number of Trades = Total Target Profit / Total Expected Value per Trade
- Number of Trades = 3000 / 65 â‰ˆ 46.15 (rounded up to 47 trades)

# Profit Projection:
- With 2 times Expected Values per day, a profit of $130.
- Trading every weekday, a weekly profit of $650.
- It might take approximately 4-5 weeks to reach the $3000 target profit.

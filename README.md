# Future Data Acquisition, Candlestick Plotting, and Intraday Performance Analysis

## Introduction
This project offers a robust suite of tools for financial data acquisition, candlestick plotting, and performance analysis tailored for intraday traders. It integrates data fetching from [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) at custom intervals (e.g., every 1, 5 minutes) and leverages [plotly](https://plotly.com/) for dynamic visualizations. Key features include:

- **EMA 20, Pre-high, Pre-low, Pre-open, and Pre-close** support for Regular Trading Hours (RTH).
- **Replay functionality** from the first to the nth bar, enhancing analysis flexibility.
- **Compatibility with Tradovate and TopStepX** for downloading and visualizing intraday trading performance directly on the graph, including entry/exit points and P&L metrics.
- **Alternative to paid versions** of platforms like [TradingView](https://tradingview.com/), offering cost-effective solutions with similar functionalities.

Results are efficiently organized and saved in the `./html` directory for easy access.

## Getting Started
Begin by executing the following commands:

- `make`: Displays all available commands.
- `make data`: Retrieves data via yfinance.
- `make report`: Generates candlestick plots with specified intervals and includes performance summaries in `./html/Summary.md` for comprehensive HTML reports.
- `make clean`: Clears compiled files to ensure a clean setup.

## Configuration Settings
Configure the project settings through the `config.ini` file, detailed as follows:

### Global Configuration
- **log_path**: Sets the log file storage directory, defaulting to `./log`.
- **performance_data_path**: Specifies where performance data is stored, default from [Tradovate](https://www.tradovate.com/), default `./data/performance/`.
- **future_data_path**: Defines the directory for future data sourced from [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/), default `./data/future/`.

```ini
[global]
log_path = ./log
performance_data_path = ./data/performance/
future_data_path = ./data/future/
```

### Future Data Configuration
- **start_date**: Sets the initial date for data retrieval.
- **interval**: Defines the data intervals in minutes.
- **tickers**: Lists the ticker symbols for data acquisition.

```ini
[future]
start_date = 2024-04-22
interval = 1, 5
tickers = MESM24.CME, MNQM24.CME
```

### Report Configuration
- **date**: Specifies the date for analysis.
- **ticker**: Indicates the ticker symbol under analysis.
- **summary_md_file**: Path to the Markdown summary file.
- **html_path**: Directory for storing HTML reports.
- **html_src_path**: Directory for HTML source files.
- **template_path**: Location of Jinja2 template files for report generation.

```ini
[report]
date = 2024-04-12
ticker = MNQM24
summary_md_file = ./notes/Summary.md
html_path = ./html/
html_src_path = ./html/src/
template_path = ./src/jinja2/
```

Adjust these parameters in the `config.ini` file to tailor the data acquisition and analysis processes to your specific needs, optimizing the toolâ€™s functionality across various trading scenarios.
